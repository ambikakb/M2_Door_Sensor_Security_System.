# INTRODUCTION
* Door plays an important role in home security.
* Door Sensor Security System implemented by using atemga328p.
* In This system we use switch to close or open the door.
* We can also use sensors instead of switch.
* Power Supply is given to the circuit i.e 5v.
* Here we use LED as an indicator, whether the door is opened or closed.
* If the switch is closed the LED will blink, else the LED will not blink
 
## OBJECTIVE
* For security purpose, to check whether the door is open or close.
